# ⚡ Energy Demand Forecasting — End-to-End Data Science Guide

This project focuses on **energy demand forecasting** using time series data.  
The goal is to build accurate, reliable, and production-ready forecasting models through **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, **modeling**, and **evaluation** techniques.

---

## 🧩 1️⃣ Data Understanding & Exploration

**Objective:** Gain insight into data structure, temporal patterns, and relationships.

**Key Actions:**
- Examine data types and missing values.
- Confirm datetime format and time granularity.
- Visualize demand trends, seasonality, and anomalies.
- Compute correlations between demand and external variables (temperature, humidity, etc.).
- Identify outliers or missing timestamps.

---

## 🧹 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

**Goal:** Prepare clean, consistent, and reliable data for modeling.

**Techniques:**
- Convert and set `datetime` as index.
- Resample data to ensure uniform frequency.
- Handle missing values with time-based interpolation or forward/backward fill.
- Detect and smooth outliers using statistical rules (IQR, Z-score).
- Apply normalization or standardization to stabilize input variables.

## 🧠 3️⃣ Feature Engineering

**Goal:** Create powerful predictive features that capture temporal, environmental, and behavioral patterns.

### ⏰ A. Time-Based Features
- Hour of day, day of week, weekend flag, month, quarter, year.
- Public holidays and daylight hours (for seasonal variations).
- Cyclical encoding (sin/cos) for periodic features like hour and month.

### 🌦️ B. Weather & External Features
- Include temperature, humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, etc.
- Add categorical weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy).
- Compute interaction terms (e.g., temperature × humidity).

### 🔁 C. Lag & Rolling Window Features
- Past demand values (lags) to model temporal dependencies.
- Rolling mean, standard deviation, min/max over past windows.
- Exponential weighted averages for recency weighting.

### 🔄 D. Seasonal Decomposition Features
- Extract and include **trend**, **seasonal**, and **residual** components.

### 🧩 E. Interaction & Derived Features
- Nonlinear transformations and feature interactions.
- Polynomial combinations for complex relationships.

## ⚖️ 4️⃣ Stationarity & Transformation

**Goal:** Stabilize variance and remove trend/seasonality to improve model performance.

**Techniques:**
- Log or Box-Cox transformation for variance stabilization.
- Differencing (first or seasonal) to achieve stationarity.
- Conduct ADF or KPSS tests to validate stationarity.

---

## 🧮 5️⃣ Feature Selection

**Goal:** Identify the most impactful predictors.

**Approaches:**
- Correlation analysis to remove multicollinearity.
- Mutual information and permutation importance.
- Model-based selection (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost feature importance).
- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for optimal subset identification.

---

## 🧩 6️⃣ Data Splitting & Validation Strategy

**Goal:** Evaluate models on realistic, time-respecting data splits.

**Strategies:**
- Maintain chronological order (no random shuffling).
- Use:
  - **Train/Validation/Test split** (e.g., 70/20/10).
  - **TimeSeriesSplit** or **Walk-forward validation** for rolling forecasts.
- Validate across multiple seasonal cycles for robust generalization.

## 🧮 7️⃣ Model Selection & Strategy

**Goal:** Select and combine models that best capture temporal and nonlinear relationships.

### 📊 A. Classical Time Series Models
- **ARIMA / SARIMA** — for univariate and seasonal forecasting.
- **SARIMAX** — includes external regressors (e.g., weather data).
- **Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters)** — captures trend and seasonality.

### 🤖 B. Machine Learning Models
- **Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso** — for linear patterns.
- **Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost** — for nonlinear relationships and feature interactions.
- These models perform well with engineered features.

### 🧬 C. Deep Learning Models
- **LSTM / GRU** — capture long-term dependencies.
- **CNN-LSTM** — combines spatial and temporal pattern detection.
- **Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)** — efficient for long-range dependencies.
- **Transformers for Time Series** — powerful for complex, long-horizon forecasting.

### 🔗 D. Hybrid / Ensemble Models
- Combine **SARIMAX** for trend-seasonality and **XGBoost** for nonlinear residuals.
- Ensemble multiple model types to enhance robustness and accuracy.

## ⚙️ 8️⃣ Model Optimization

**Goal:** Tune hyperparameters to maximize performance.

**Techniques:**
- Grid Search, Random Search, or Bayesian Optimization (Optuna, Hyperopt).
- Time-aware cross-validation for reliable tuning.
- For deep learning models:
  - Early stopping
  - Learning rate scheduling
  - Dropout and batch normalization for regularization

## 📊 9️⃣ Evaluation Metrics

**Goal:** Quantify forecast accuracy and reliability.

| Metric | Description | Best Use |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **MAE** | Mean Absolute Error | Measures average magnitude of errors |
| **RMSE** | Root Mean Squared Error | Penalizes larger errors |
| **MAPE** | Mean Absolute Percentage Error | Scale-independent, interpretable |
| **R²** | Coefficient of Determination | Measures overall model fit |
| **SMAPE** | Symmetric MAPE | Balanced metric for over/under predictions |

**Tip:** Evaluate models across short, medium, and long forecast horizons.

## 🔍 🔟 Residual Analysis & Diagnostics

**Goal:** Validate that model residuals are random and unbiased.

**Checks:**
- Plot residuals over time — should appear as white noise.
- Analyze residual autocorrelation — no visible patterns.
- Detect bias across specific days, months, or conditions.

## 🚀 11️⃣ Deployment Readiness

**Goal:** Operationalize the forecasting pipeline.

**Best Practices:**
- Build end-to-end preprocessing + modeling pipelines.
- Automate periodic retraining using rolling windows.
- Monitor data drift and retrain when necessary.
- Deploy via **Flask**, **FastAPI**, or **Streamlit**.
- Schedule predictions with **Airflow** or **Cron Jobs**.

## 💡 12️⃣ Advanced Accuracy Improvement Techniques

**For enhanced model precision:**
- Segment-wise scaling (normalize per season).
- Ensemble statistical, ML, and DL models.
- Transfer learning from similar regional datasets.
- Anomaly filtering and demand correction.
- Incorporate **weather forecasts** for future exogenous features.
- Use **Fourier series** to model multiple seasonalities.
