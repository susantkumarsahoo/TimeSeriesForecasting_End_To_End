## 1. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

### 1.1 Handle Missing Values

**Multiple strategies for different scenarios:**

- **Forward fill** - For short gaps in time series continuity
- **Backward fill** - When future context is available
- **Linear interpolation** - For smooth trends between data points
- **Spline interpolation** - For non-linear patterns
- **Seasonal decomposition + interpolation** - Preserves seasonal patterns
- **KNN imputation** - Uses temporal neighbors for imputation
- **Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE)** - For complex missingness patterns

### 1.2 Outlier Detection & Treatment

**Detection Methods:**
- Statistical methods: Z-score (> 3 standard deviations), IQR method
- Isolation Forest: For multivariate outliers
- DBSCAN: Density-based clustering
- Domain knowledge: Flag physically impossible values (negative demand, extreme spikes)

**Treatment Options:**
- Cap/floor values at percentiles (e.g., 1st and 99th)
- Winsorization
- Removal with proper justification
- Keep if domain-valid (actual peak events)

### 1.3 Data Quality Checks

Essential validation steps:
- Check for duplicate timestamps
- Verify timestamp continuity (no unexpected gaps)
- Ensure proper timezone handling
- Validate sampling frequency consistency
- Check for data leakage issues
- Verify data types (datetime, numeric)

### 1.4 Resampling & Aggregation

- Standardize to consistent intervals (hourly, daily)
- Aggregate sub-hourly data using appropriate functions (mean, sum)
- Handle daylight saving time transitions properly
- Ensure alignment across all data sources

---

## 2. Feature Engineering (Critical for Accuracy)

### 2.1 Temporal Features

**Use cyclical encoding for periodic features to preserve continuity:**

- Hour of day (sin/cos transformation)
- Day of week (sin/cos transformation)
- Day of month (sin/cos transformation)
- Month of year (sin/cos transformation)
- Week of year (sin/cos transformation)
- Quarter
- Is_weekend, is_business_day
- Days to/from holidays

**Why cyclical encoding?** Hour 23 and Hour 0 are adjacent but numerically far apart. Sine/cosine encoding preserves this circular relationship.

### 2.2 Lag Features

Create multiple lag horizons to capture temporal dependencies:

**Recent history:**
- lag_1h, lag_2h, lag_3h

**Daily patterns:**
- lag_24h (same hour yesterday)

**Weekly patterns:**
- lag_168h (same hour last week)

**Yearly patterns:**
- lag_8760h (same hour last year)

**Rolling statistics:**
- Rolling means: 3h, 6h, 12h, 24h, 168h windows
- Rolling std: 24h, 168h (volatility measures)
- Rolling min/max: 24h, 168h
- Exponentially weighted moving averages (EWMA)

### 2.3 Calendar & Event Features

- Public holidays (binary + one-hot encoding)
- School holidays/vacation periods
- Special events (sports events, festivals, concerts)
- Religious observances (Ramadan, Christmas, etc.)
- Holiday proximity (days before/after major holidays)
- Bridge days (between holidays and weekends)

### 2.4 Weather Features (Essential!)

Weather is a primary driver of energy demand:

**Temperature features:**
- Temperature (actual, feels-like, heat index)
- Temperature lags (1h, 24h, 168h)
- Cooling Degree Days (CDD): max(0, temp - 65°F)
- Heating Degree Days (HDD): max(0, 65°F - temp)

**Other weather variables:**
- Humidity (relative humidity %)
- Wind speed
- Cloud cover
- Precipitation
- Solar radiation (affects solar generation)
- Weather forecast data (if available)

**Non-linear temperature effects:**
- Temperature squared (temp²)
- Temperature cubed (temp³)

### 2.5 Derived Time Features

- is_heating_season (typically Nov-Mar in Northern Hemisphere)
- is_cooling_season (typically May-Sep)
- is_business_hours (e.g., 8am-6pm weekdays)
- is_peak_hours (typically 5pm-9pm)
- load_shape_type (weekday/weekend/holiday classification)
- daylight_hours (from sunrise to sunset)
- is_transition_season (spring/fall)

### 2.6 Seasonal Decomposition Features

Extract trend, seasonal, and residual components using STL decomposition:
- Trend component - long-term direction
- Seasonal component - repeating patterns
- Residual component - remaining variation

Use these components as additional features in your model.

### 2.7 Autoregressive Features

**Differences:**
- demand_diff_1h, demand_diff_24h

**Percentage changes:**
- pct_change_1h, pct_change_24h

**Rate of change:**
- How fast demand is changing

**Acceleration:**
- Second derivative (rate of change of rate of change)

### 2.8 Interaction Features

Capture non-linear relationships:
- temperature × hour_of_day
- temperature × is_weekend
- humidity × temperature
- hour_of_day × day_of_week

### 2.9 Domain-Specific Features

- Economic indicators (GDP growth, manufacturing index)
- Population growth trends
- Industrial production indices
- Energy prices (if feedback loop exists)
- Regional events (conventions, major conferences)

---

## 3. Data Transformation & Scaling

### 3.1 Stationarity Tests

Test whether your time series is stationary:
- **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test** - Tests for unit root
- **KPSS test** - Tests for stationarity
- **Apply differencing** if non-stationary (subtracting previous values)

**Stationary data has:** constant mean, constant variance, no trend or seasonality in structure.

### 3.2 Scaling Strategies

Choose based on your model requirements:

- **StandardScaler** - For linear models, neural networks (mean=0, std=1)
- **MinMaxScaler** - For neural networks (scales to [0,1])
- **RobustScaler** - If outliers are present (uses median and IQR)
- **PowerTransformer** - For skewed distributions (Box-Cox, Yeo-Johnson)

**Note:** Tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) don't require scaling.

### 3.3 Target Variable Treatment

- Check distribution (normal, skewed?)
- Log transform for right-skewed data: log(demand)
- Square root transform: sqrt(demand)
- Box-Cox transform for stabilizing variance
- Consider inverse transformation after prediction

---

## 4. Train-Validation-Test Split Strategy

### 4.1 Time-Based Splitting (Never Random!)

**CRITICAL:** Never use random splitting for time series!

**Typical split for 3 years of data:**
- **Training: 70-75%** (oldest data, e.g., Year 1 + first 9 months of Year 2)
- **Validation: 10-15%** (middle period, e.g., last 3 months of Year 2)
- **Test: 10-15%** (most recent data, e.g., Year 3)

**Why chronological?** Models must learn from past to predict future. Random splitting creates data leakage.

### 4.2 Time Series Cross-Validation

Use TimeSeriesSplit for robust evaluation:

**Rolling window approach:**
- Fixed-size training window that moves forward
- Tests model on different time periods

**Expanding window approach:**
- Training window grows with each split
- More data but potential for concept drift

**Gap between splits:**
- Optional gap to prevent leakage
- Simulates real forecasting scenario

### 4.3 Important Considerations

- Include all seasons in training (minimum 1 full year, preferably 2-3)
- Ensure test set represents target deployment period
- Watch for concept drift between periods
- Validate on multiple time periods to ensure robustness
- Consider seasonal validation (test on different seasons)
